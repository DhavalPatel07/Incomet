                <p>Once upon a time, Prince was one of you, relying on the content on YouTube or other free sites. 4 months into that and he made big losses, exhausting all his capital. The worst part? No learning despite the loss, the time, and the effort. Many of us stop here. Most consider this to be the end truth of markets, but Prince decided otherwise & joined INCOMET. His entrepreneurial instinct pushed him to take a leap to transform his business in the market. As Prince says, "Incomet is why I continue to think big with better psychology and confidence. I see losses even now, but they are less than what I make and learn.” He sees his future in markets from a long-term perspective now. He trusts that Incomet mentors have nurtured the entrepreneur in him to the extent that he pursues to have a Hedge Fund and is actively working on educating himself on this</p>

                <p>Tanya Kapoor, an Alumna who has had a passion to become a businesswoman since 4th grade, joined us because of her partner's advice. Since he has a busy schedule and was unable to join us, he advised Tanya to join our course and educate herself in financial literacy side by side. Today, she perceives it to be one of the best pieces of advice she took. </p>
